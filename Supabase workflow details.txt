Give prompt to the user whether theyre doing the exercise properly
How will you give calories?will you give in using ML model?n r u gona integrate in mediapipe?
What type of details should be there in a dashboard?
Are u hosting mediapipe in flask?
Now ur running the script in flask right,if we run it default,itll run in local host,let it be aside
But apart from that,we have debug and run right ,there will be format for IP Adress,in that we ourself should create and give a port address
As we mentioned,its a python library we have supabase which is totally free of cost,So i have to take the IP address and Port address from this flask,we have to configure it in supabase dashboard.Now the camera will start right,at that place
Database client is there right,we have to initialize,once after we initialized,well be printing in debug console right,without printing there
So if we change the trsck like this,there is a database called postgreSQL,we can store there also,but the problem is,as it is a real time data,we have to open another extension in supabase(real time,subscriptorial time)only then we can listen.
Apart from that ,there's real time DB in that console,everything is nosql,so no problem(all tables,rows only,UI will also be good,we can write query there itself)
When we get into real time DB,we can directly draw rows n columns,but from image when he does an exercise wrong,well get prompt from mediapipe,so when the output in which hes there comes,if i wana store that image also in real time DB,then I have to create Storage,then we have to store the image URL,then where we wanted to display our image as at this time,at this count,ur position was wrong


we can do cronjob also,they provide so many plugins,we can easily configure flask,he ran his model in flask,when it comes to python its easy bcoz they have sdk in which community lib was only there, but for python there is notegs,react,javascript ku they have their own.They have Graph SQL where we can draw our graphs (or) use UI framework graph,and we can pass the data to graph.All will happen in asynchronised thread.

Supabase will recognise only if we give the IP address and 
Edge fn,graphQL , webhooks can be used in that,that to for python SDK,we can connect to anything.

We can even host streamlit in Supabase to run our website.we can configure every thing in our dashboard itself,we neednt write any additional code for front end.
